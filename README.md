# AES and SideChannelAttack

This is the repository with the Code for the 2021-2022 Capstone Project of Uljad Berdica, Ahmad Salous and Yusuf Jimoh Omotayo. This repository features the code for the FPGA implementation of AES and the different iterations of the statistical attack design along with the data preparation scripts. 

**aes** folder contains the AES code 
**attack_Final_code** contains the final version of the attack

_However_, we strongly recommend going through the Jupyter Notebooks folder to get a better understanding of Correlation Power Analysis and data handling approaches as well as through the Verilog folder.
