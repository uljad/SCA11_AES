            Sample Data For the Side Channel Analysis Tool 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This folder containes sample data to test the Side Channel Analysis 
Tool. It consists of the following:
	
	(1) 'data_x3000.txt' - This is a sample set of 3000 power
	     traces collected on a SASEBO-GII FPGA performing AES-128

	(2) 'ct_x3000.txt' - This is the corresponding hexadecimal
	     ciphertext for each of the 3000 sample power traces provided. 

These traces can be used to verify that the tool is working properly (see
the README file in the top level directory for the usage). If done properly,
the recovered AES Key should be the follwing:
	 
	'1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15'
